> IT’S GOOD / IT’S BAD

Saying this doesn’t change reality, it just superimposes a label onto something. If you want to communicate that change is necessary to others, let them to see what you see, so that they can draw their own conclusions. It’s possible to not call scorpions evil, while also responding rationally when you see one.

> IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT / IT SHOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED

How *could* it have turned out any differently, given the circumstances/causes it came out of?

> IF IT HAD DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, IT MAY BE MORE PREFERABLE

True, but this statement doesn’t seem useful by itself.

> IT NEEDS TO CHANGE

Can it change, entirely by itself, with no outside help? Assuming *it* is the result of *something*, does it not make more sense to address the *cause* rather than to demand *it* changes?

> THERE’S POTENTIAL FOR POSITIVE CHANGE

This statement implies acceptance and openness to solutions.

> THEY NEED TO SEE ME HOW I SEE MYSELF

Why is it wrong that they come to their own conclusions? Why is it your job to police their worldview? Why are you placing your happiness in their hands?

> THEY MADE ME DO/FEEL …

Did they make you feel that emotion, or did you have an emotional response to what they did? Are your emotional responses always appropriate? Did your emotional response help you here? Did you actually decide how you wish to feel? Do you have control over your emotions?

> IT WON’T CHANGE

This implies some acceptance of what is, but lacks understanding. The only constant in life is change. Furthermore, positive change seems to favor those who are open to it. Having blinders on, telling oneself “It won’t change for the better.” can make it difficult to perceive actual opportunities for positive change.

> IT’S NOT GREAT, BUT I CAN’T CHANGE IT

The upside here is that you’ve “let go” of trying to control things, somewhat. The possible downside is that this might lead to nihilistic views. Destruction is not the only path to preferable realities, and nihilists don’t think things CAN get better. Sometimes this viewpoint is an attempt to control one’s own emotions in a destructive way, such as “I’m not going to get my hopes up because I refuse to feel further disappointment.”

> IT IS WHAT IT IS, AND I CAN’T CHANGE IT

Having let go more, now you are free to watch it naturally unfold. By watching it without interfering, you can see its inner mechanisms- you begin to see what it WANTS to do. This is what a true observer of nature does. Nonjudgmental observation. Holding off on ascribing value to something in order to see what happens.

> I WON’T BE HAPPY UNTIL IT CHANGES

That’s your choice.

> OKAY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING BE DIFFERENT, SO HOW I’M GOING TO RESPOND TO THE SITUATION I’M IN IS THIS WAY

You are not asking anyone to respond or act in a way that isn’t their choice. You are not demanding others change their worldview. You are only intending to create positive experiences. You are making sure that your own needs are met.
