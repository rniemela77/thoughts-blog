#Flow
You have personal motivations,
desired future experiences.
The events around you seem to push in certain directions, 
like a nonstop flowing stream.

In being too pre-occupied with what YOU want,
you cannot use the flow around you.
In being too consumed by what is going on,
you forget who you truly are.

To know what you want
and to observe the flow,
you can let go.

Let the flow
be the flow,
and it will carry you
to where you want to go.

Self and Other
are two sides
of the same coin.

Know both,
and you stay on course.
