# Flow
You have personal motivations-

your desired future experiences.
<br><br>

The events around you seem to push in certain directions, 

like a nonstop flowing stream.
<br><br>

In being too pre-occupied with what YOU want,

you cannot use the flow around you.
<br><br>

In being too consumed by what is going on,

you forget who you truly are.
<br><br>


To know what you want

and to observe the flow,

you can let go.
<br><br>


Let the flow

be the flow,

and it will carry you

to where you want to go.
<br><br>


Self and Other

are two sides

of the same coin.


Know both,

and you stay on course.
