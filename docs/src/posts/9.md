# Ease

There's an easy way to improve.

Do others need to conform to your desires?

Assume to not know everything.

Let go of needing to manipulate things outside of you.

---

In day to day life, you are in autopilot mode.

In this state, you respond to things in the same way you've responded in the past.

Your ability to judge and creatively think with your full faculties is restricted.

You are a slave to who you used to be, and you create more of what is.

---

Interactions can be seen as experiments. 

Who says tomorrow has to be the same way today was?

Always choose to end things on a positive attitude.

Give up trying to impress others or please them.

Allow others to just exist as they are.

Pay attention to what's in front of you- but leave room for what you don't know.

---

The willingness to feel -> daydreaming

The willingness to have -> reaching out and taking it

---

You don't need to make others wrong. It doesn't do anything for you.

You consistently live in a way where you are under control.

Because of this control, you are coordinated.

Because of this coordination, you can stick to your plans.

Because you stick to your plans, you can make meaningful changes that accumulate.

Because of accumulated changes, your vision is made real.
