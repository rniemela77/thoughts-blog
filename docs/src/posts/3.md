# Rights

## Each person has the right to make their own value judgments.

No person has the right to force another to agree with their value judgment. By that, I mean I do not need to see myself as good/bad/etc in any way just because someone else does. How I feel towards the world is ONLY ever up to me to decide.

If I want to live in such a way where I maximize my personal time and give little, that is my right. Others might have negative value judgments towards that. I’m allowed to feel however I want, and they are allowed to feel how they want.

## It’s not my job to make others see me a certain way.

It’s not my job to manage another person’s emotions.

What is truly gained by gaining the validation of others? Congrats, you did what the tribe wanted. The tribe has never wanted anything “wrong” before! (sarcasm)

If you do something for the good favor of others, and then they don’t return the affection and love and admiration that you expected, ***how does that make you feel?***

If you do something because you think it’s good, and no one gives you that admiration, ***should you really care?***

Is it my job to get my parents to respect me? Is it my job to make sure others like me?

Do other’s opinions of me actually affect me?
