# Action, not words.
Let others discover their true motivation.
<br><br>

Let others know your beliefs through your actions,

not your words.
<br><br>

Show appreciation through action,

not flattery.
<br><br>

Let your content speak for itself.
<br><br>

Let others come to their own conclusions.
<br><br>

If flattery is necessary to get something done,

external validation is prioritized over

Self-validation.
<br><br>

Give others the chance

to see what is left

when words are not present.
