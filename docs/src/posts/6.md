# Action, not words.
Let others discover their true motivation.

Let others know your beliefs through your actions,
not your words.

Show appreciation through action,
not flattery.

Let your content speak for itself.

Let others come to their own conclusions.

If flattery is necessary to get something done,
external validation is prioritized over
Self-validation.

Give others the chance
to see what is left
when words are not present.
