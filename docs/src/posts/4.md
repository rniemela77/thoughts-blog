# Inner vs Outer
Inner dialogue is with self.

Outer dialogue is with universe.
<br><br>

Inner dialogue shuts the universe out.
<br><br>

Outer dialogue allows the universe to receive your message.
<br><br>

In a defensive state, you shut the outside out.

In a receptive state, you allow the universe to be.

Allow yourself to do one thing:

	‚óè	Passively let the outside know what you like.
 <br><br>
 
You are not grabbing the universe by the throat. You are not demanding. You are not insisting. You are impassionately sending out your order to the infinite.
