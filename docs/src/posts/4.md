# Inner vs Outer
Inner dialogue with self.
Outer dialogue with universe.

Inner dialogue shuts the universe out.

Outer dialogue allows the universe to receive your message.

In a defensive state, you shut the outside out.
In a receptive state, you allow the universe to be.

Allow yourself to do one thing:
	‚óè	Passively let the outside know what you like.
 
You are not grabbing the universe by the throat. You are not demanding. You are not insisting. You are impassionately sending out your order to the infinite.
